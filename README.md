# Speech Emotion Recognition

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for performing **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** using audio data. It focuses on preprocessing emotional speech samples using `librosa`, making them ready for training deep learning models.

## Project Overview

- Dataset: [Kaggle - Speech Emotion Recognition (English)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dmitrybabko/speech-emotion-recognition-en)
- Tools used: `librosa`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`
- Platform: Google Colab

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses emotional speech samples
- Extracts features for use in neural networks
- Clean and modular code, suitable for model training

## Dependencies

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install torchaudio librosa pandas numpy scikit-learn tqdm
